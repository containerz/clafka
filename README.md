# tiny-kafka

Concept:

Provide the simplest possible consumer and producer interfaces for kafka  
by exposing the new java producer api and the simple consumer.

## Usage

LEIN HERE

### Consumer
I have only provided a wrapper for the simple consumer, a good zookeeper consumer api can be found in (http://github.com/pingles/clj-kafka)[clj-kafka]

First create a `SimpleConsumer` instance with `consumer`

```clojure
(def c (consumer "localhost" 9092))
```

The `SimpleConsumer` talks to a single broker, and can only receive data for partitions on which that
broker is the leader.

However, you can ask any broker which broker is the leader for a partition in your cluster via
`find-leader` or `find-leaders`

#### Finding a leader
```clojure 
(find-leader c "my-topic" 0)
;;=>
{:host "localhost" :port 9092 :id 0}
```

Lets assume the existing consumer is talking to the broker that owns partition *0*. If it wasn't 
then you would have to use `consumer` to give you a `SimpleConsumer` for that broker.

#### Fetching
You can fetch some data from a log with `fetch`

```clojure
;;fetches 1024 bytes of data from my-topic partition 0, offset 0.
(fetch c "my-topic" 0 0 1024)
;; =>
```
`fetch` will throw exceptions for the various 
kafka error codes given by the `ErrorMapping` class in kafka, if you do not want this and you want to manually check error-codes etc you can do so with the underlying `-fetch` fn.

So for example, if the leader for a partition changes, you should expect `fetch` to throw a 
kafka.common.LeaderNotA

#### Fetching a seq

You can fetch a lazy seq of the entire log until the current head with `fetch-log`
```clojure
;;fetches a seq of messages lazily from the log in blocks of *default-fetch-size*
;;from my-topic partition 0 offset 0
(fetch-log c "my-topic" 0 0) 
;;=>
;;you can also manually specify the fetch size to use... (here we say 1024 bytes)
(fetch-log c "my-topic" 0 0 1024)
;;=>
```

You can also return an infinite seq of messages with `log-seq`, this sequence does not 
terminate when the log is exhausted, rather it enters a polling mode allowing you to block on new messages being added to the log over time.

```clojure
;;will use the default size and poll time parameters (512KB and 1 second)
(log-seq c "my-topic" 0 0)
;;=>

;;you can manually specify the size and poll-ms through a configuration map
(log-seq c "my-topic 0 0 {:size 1024, :poll-ms 2000})
``` 
 

`fetch-log` and `fetch-seq` will skip messages that are too large to be fetched with a single fetch,
so tune the fetch-size carefully. The default fetch size is 512KB should be plenty 
for most use cases.
